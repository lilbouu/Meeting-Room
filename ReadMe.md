## 🚀 Installation Guide

### Step 1: Flash the firmware

1. **Connect the board to your computer** via a USB-C cable.

2. **Run the flasher utility:**

   * Locate `flash_tool.exe` in the repository
   * Run it — the tool will automatically detect the COM port
   * Make sure the CP210x driver is installed on your system
   * Follow the on-screen instructions

3. **Wait for completion:**

   * Flashing takes a few minutes
   * After the process finishes the board will automatically reboot
   * The main application screen will appear on the display

### Step 3: Connect to Wi-Fi

You can send Wi-Fi credentials using the app or the companion tool `CrowPanelConfiguration.exe`:

1. **Open the configuration utility** on your PC
2. **Enter Wi-Fi details:**

   * SSID (network name)
   * Network password
3. **Select the COM port** that the board is connected to
4. **Click "Send"** to transmit the configuration

Wi-Fi credentials are stored in the device non-volatile memory and used automatically on every boot.

### Step 4: Connect Google Calendar (optional)

To show events from Google Calendar:

1. **Get the ICS link:**

   * Open Google Calendar on your computer or smartphone
   * Under **My calendars** find the calendar you want
   * Click the three dots (⋮) next to the calendar name
   * Choose **Settings and sharing**
   * Scroll down to **Integrate calendar**
   * Copy the **Secret address in iCal format** — this is the ICS link you need

2. **Send the link to the device:**

   * Use `CrowPanelConfiguration.exe`
   * Paste the ICS URL
   * Select the device COM port
   * Click **Send**

3. **Verify:**

   * Open the **Calendar** screen on the panel
   * Check that your events appear

### Step 5: Connect the air quality module (optional)

If you want to monitor air quality:

1. **Install the EnSens module:**

   * Locate the W-M connector on the board
   * Gently insert the EnSens module into that connector

2. **Check pin orientation:**

   * The board has markings next to the connector
   * Make sure the module is aligned with the 0/1 markings

3. **Use the Climate screen:**

   * From the dashboard open the **Climate** screen — IAQ and CO₂ values should be displayed
